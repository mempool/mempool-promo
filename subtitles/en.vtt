00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.480
Welcome to mempool.space, an open-source project&nbsp;
that provides data and tools to take your Bitcoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.760
experience to the next level. Our mempool dashboard&nbsp;
provides an at-a-glance look at the real-time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.040
status of a Bitcoin node's mempool. View Bitcoin&nbsp;
blocks through our one-of-a-kind visualization.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480
Forecasted mempool blocks appear to the left of&nbsp;
the white line, and confirmed blocks to the right.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.680
Take a peek within a forecasted mempool&nbsp;
blog for a more granular view, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.400
a visualization of included transactions. Drill&nbsp;
down into the details at the transaction level,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.480
and with real-time tracking, you can see the moment&nbsp;
a transaction confirms. If your transaction funds a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.440
new Lightning channel, you can see various details&nbsp;
about it our new Lightning network explorer.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.320
The mempool dashboard also includes&nbsp;
a fee-estimation widget that helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.760
take the guesswork out of choosing an&nbsp;
appropriate fee for your transactions.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.520
For miners, we've built a mining dashboard&nbsp;
that provides meaningful metrics including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.000
fee and subsidy data, difficulty and hash rate&nbsp;
stats, pool dominance, and more. Our historical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.840
graphs bring all this data together and display it&nbsp;
across time through beautifully-rendered visuals.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.880
mempool.space doesn't have any advertisements or&nbsp;
third-party tracking. Still, trusted third parties&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.520
are security holes, and the most private way&nbsp;
to look up your own addresses and transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.880
is through your own Bitcoin node. We make this&nbsp;
easyâ€”you can install your very own instance of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.800
mempool.space with just one click on Raspberry Pi&nbsp;
full-node distros like Umbrel, RaspiBlitz,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.800
Start9 embassyOS, and more. Or, for advanced&nbsp;
users, install our pre-built Docker images on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.000
your own server. Additionally, mempool.space is&nbsp;
integrated into a growing number of popular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.080
wallets and exchange. Explore the full&nbsp;
Bitcoin ecosystem with data from testnet,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.280
